4. What happens when I leave fastbox.com to visit a FastBox linked web site?
Parts of fastbox.com, such as FastBox Global Trade Manager, consist of products and services hosted by third-party businesses. When you leave fastbox.com to visit one of these sites, the only information transferred to the third-party is the fact that you came from fastbox.com (the referring address).

This practice allows the third-party to monitor its own web site traffic, but does not provide them with any information about you. FastBox is not responsible or liable for the independent privacy policies of our third-party sites. You should consult the privacy policies at those sites to determine how your information may be used.
